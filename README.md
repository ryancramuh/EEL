# EEL
The EEL-32 is a pipelined 32-bit RV32I processor. Though the EEL-32 resembles Cal Poly SLO's OTTER core, it will have multiple new ISA extensions as well as an interrupt system. The goal of the EEL is to extend the OTTER, and achieve RTOS compatibility. A secondary goal of the EEL is to be the basis a later, ASIC hardened revision.
## ISA Extensions
The EEL will target several new extensions:
<br>Zifencei
<br>Zicsr
<br>M - multiply/divide
<br>A - atomic
<br>C - compressed
